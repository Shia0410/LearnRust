[dependencies]
# Examples of ways to do dependencies.

# Note dependancies can also be done relative to the file path for example
# serde = {path = "./src/libraries/serde"}

#   serde = { git = "https://github.com/serde-rs/serde" }

# A specific branch
#   serde = { git = "https://github.com/serde-rs/serde", branch = "next" }

# A specific commit hash
#   serde = { git = "https://github.com/serde-rs/serde", rev = "7e19ae8c9486a3bbbe51f1befb05edee94c454f9" }

# ALSO TO NOTE !!!

# We are capable of many other things within our manifest file such as specifying 
# [dev-dependencies], declaring [features] for our own crate, creating a 
# [profile] for specific compilation settings, and even making a [workspace] for 
# managing multiple crates within the same package.
